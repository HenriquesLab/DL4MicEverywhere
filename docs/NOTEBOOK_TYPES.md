# Types of Notebooks in DL4MicEverywhere

DL4MicEverywhere provides support for three distinct categories of notebooks:

## ZeroCostDL4Mic Notebooks

These notebooks are adaptations from the [ZeroCostDL4Mic](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic) project. They encompass a variety of common deep learning workflows for bioimage analysis.

You can find these notebooks in the `notebooks/ZeroCostDL4Mic_notebooks/` directory.

Examples of these notebooks include U-Net 2D, StarDist 3D, CycleGAN, and more.

## Bespoke Notebooks 

These notebooks are specifically developed for DL4MicEverywhere and offer unique functionalities. 

They are located under `notebooks/Bespoke_notebooks/`.

## External Notebooks

These notebooks are contributions from external collaborators or groups.

They are located under `notebooks/External_notebooks/`.

An example is `FRUNet-Exosomes` contributed by the [Biomedical Signal Interpretation and Computational Simulation (BSICoS) group](https://github.com/BSEL-UC3M).

This categorization allows separating out notebooks based on their source and customization needs. Core notebooks from ZeroCostDL4Mic are kept isolated. Bespoke notebooks can leverage the full capabilities of the DL4MicEverwhere framework. External notebooks enable community contributions.
