# Notebook Types in DL4MicEverywhere

DL4MicEverywhere supports 3 categories of notebooks:

## ZeroCostDL4Mic Notebooks

These are notebooks converted from [ZeroCostDL4Mic](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic). They cover common deep learning workflows for bioimage analysis.

The notebooks are located under `notebooks/ZeroCostDL4Mic_notebooks/`.

Examples include U-Net 2D, StarDist 3D, CycleGAN etc.

## Bespoke Notebooks 

These are custom notebooks developed specifically for DL4MicEverywhere. 

They are located under `notebooks/Bespoke_notebooks/`.

## External Notebooks

These are notebooks contributed by external collaborators/groups.

They are located under `notebooks/External_notebooks/`.

An example is `FRUNet-Exosomes` contributed by the [Biomedical Signal Interpretation and Computational Simulation (BSICoS) group](https://github.com/BSEL-UC3M).

This categorization allows separating out notebooks based on their source and customization needs. Core notebooks from ZeroCostDL4Mic are kept isolated. Bespoke notebooks can leverage the full capabilities of the DL4MicEverwhere framework. External notebooks enable community contributions.
