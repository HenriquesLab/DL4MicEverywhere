# Preparing Data 

The DL4MicEverywhere notebooks are generally compatible with standard microscopy image formats and necessitate a specific data structure. Here are some guidelines for preparing your data for use with the notebooks:

## Supported Image Formats

The notebooks are compatible with uncompressed image formats:

- TIFF (.tif)
- PNG (.png)
- JPEG (.jpg)

Proprietary microscope files or **compressed TIFFs** are not directly supported. These need to be converted to one of the supported formats. Fiji/ImageJ can be used for this purpose. Refer to the [troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page for more information.

## Data Organization 

Your image data should be organized into separate folders:

- `raw` - This folder should contain the raw input images.
- `labels` - This folder should contain any ground truth labels.
- `train` - This folder should contain the training images (can symlink from raw).
- `test` - This folder should contain the test images (can symlink from raw).

This folder structure is expected by many of the notebooks. 

## Ground Truth

For supervised learning notebooks, ground truth labels are required, such as:

- Segmentation masks 
- Landmarks or contours
- Class labels

Store labels in common formats like PNG masks or CSV files. Ensure labels correspond to the correct input images.

## Training vs Test Split 

Your data should be split into separate training and test sets. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Symlinking can be used to avoid duplicating data between the `train` and `test` folders.

## Resizing

Many notebooks require images of a consistent size, typically 512x512 or 256x256 pixels. Resize your images to match the expected notebook input shape.

When downsizing, use a Lanczos or cubic interpolation method for optimal results.

## Normalization 

Normalize pixel values to the 0-1 range to enhance training stability.

In Python (being the image a NumPy array):

```python
img = (img - img.min()) / (img.max() - img.min() + 1e-10)
```

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation (rotations, flips, zooms, etc) can be applied to your training data to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.

The Albumentations library is recommended for augmenting microscopy data.

## Review Data

After preparation, spot check images to ensure they are in the correct formats, have clean labels, and are free from corruption or artifacts.

Any issues should be fixed before starting training to avoid errors or suboptimal results.
