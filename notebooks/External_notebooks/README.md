# YAML repository for External Notebooks

This folder contains the YAML files needed to generate Docker images associated with **External Notebooks**. Each YAML file corresponds to a specific notebook and contains references to the necessary dependencies for that notebook to run correctly. 

See the main [README](../README.md) for more information on how to build, pull and run the docker images.
