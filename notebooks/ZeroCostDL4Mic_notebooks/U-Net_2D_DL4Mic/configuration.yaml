description: 2D binary segmentation. U-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture originally used for image segmentation. The first half of the U-Net architecture is a downsampling convolutional neural network which acts as a feature extractor from input images. The other half upsamples these results and restores an image by combining results from downsampling with the upsampled images. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
